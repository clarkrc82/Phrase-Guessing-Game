# About this Project
In this project, I created a word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." There is a hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the game board displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess they phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen appears.

A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, the letter is disable on the onscreen keyboard.
